        text='Our teams are developing software for ADAS (Advance driver-assistance systems) and AD (Autonomous driving). The systems we develop are of high level of autonomy (levels 3, 4, 5) and the software intended for these purposes must be highly reliable, i.e., failure-free. In the critical operations of steering, acceleration, braking, and others, failures are not allowed, as they can directly endanger safety of the passengers.
As this is a real time software requiring timely exchange of information according to predefined priorities, we are also dealing with development of software components which provide fast and reliable communication.
